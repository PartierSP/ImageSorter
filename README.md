# ImageSorter
This utility automatically sorts your photos based on EXIF dates.  It does this by reading the EXIF creation date and then generates directories to place either copies or symbolic links of the images.  This can make sorting large quantities of images easier as usually photos of an event will only occure on one or two days.  Then finding all images of that event from several cameras will all be grouped in a single directory.
